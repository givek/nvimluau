## NVIMLUAU

Get your hawaiin shirts, it's a Neovim plugin party.

## How it works..

1. On https://nvimluau.dev/publish, add the GitHub URL for the plugin repo
2. Submitting creates a PR with a markdown file as the commit in the nvimluau repo
3. And after I'm done eating pineapple, i'll merge it.

## If you want to help develop this

`npm run dev`

## TODO

1. setup cron job to update plugin data
2. make mobile friendly
